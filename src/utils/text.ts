  jest: `Testing should not be complicated. Examples and ideas with my comments...//
  When I started my dev journey I had the opportunity to hear other developers saying: ''Testing is a waste of time'' or ''I don't know how to test my code'' or even ''No one here knows about testing''.
  That really got me thinking something was wrong, it was not supposed to be that way.//
  I admit it took me a while to start testing and understand its importance, but that was a real change.//
  In order to help people learning, and in my best effort, I started a repository focused on testing, with of comments and examples on how to perform simple tests and what to have in mind when planning tests.//
  Tests can be of great help in the development process, removing the burden of having rework and describing all things that need to be done even before writing code.//
